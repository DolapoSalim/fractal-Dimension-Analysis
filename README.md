# fractal-Dimension-Analysis
This Python script is used to generate a 3D shape of a Sierpinski carpet, and the fractal Dimension was calculated (1, 2,3):
It contains a line-by-line breakdown of how the code works.
Firstly, it generates a 3D fractal, counts occupied boxes at different scales, and computes the fractal dimension.

an example of the code ran in ethe xample can be found in my repo at: [Here](https://github.com/DolapoSalim/opencv-repo-learning/blob/main/FractalDimIn3D.py)
